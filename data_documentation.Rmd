**Data Source:** The original data sources for this dataset came from Kaggle – the air quality and 
pollution data came from the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/code/jackjaehwankim/worldwide-pollution-eda/input 
and the median and average salary data came from the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zedataweaver/global-salary-data. 
Both of these datasets are available for public use as long as it’s personal and non-commercial. 
**Variables:** The original datasets included additional variables, but the ones included here are country, 
median salary, average salary, air quality, and water pollution. The median and average salary are both 
accounted for in U.S. dollars, not accounting for cost-of-living adjustments. It is also important to 
note that air quality ranges from 0 (bad quality) to 100 (good quality) while water pollution ranges 
from 0 (no pollution) to 100 (heavy pollution).
**Summary Statistics:** Each of the 163 rows in this dataset represents a country and observations related 
to it – the median and average salary in USD and the level of average pollution. There are 5 columns in the 
dataset, each corresponding to the country name and one of the categories mentioned above. There are no missing 
values because we wanted to ensure both salary and pollution data are available for the users.
