Introduction: 

Pollution globally is a leading contributor for affecting all generations with regards to how we 
live our lives daily. From gas pollution to the growing manufacturing and modernization of countries
contributing to increasing levels of pollution. We were curious as to which countries have higher 
pollution ratings compared to others and if salary of a country would be a contributor to higher 
pollution for a particular country. Growing up, we would read articles about the alarming rates of 
increasing pollution affecting everyone globally and the negative impacts to our world. From the 
increase in wildfires, potential extinction of wildlife, and rising sea levels that could lead
to risk to humans. Given this information from media, we wanted to take a deeper dive using data 
science on which countries may play a bigger factor in increasing pollution levels globally and 
draw potential solutions using data driven predictions. Given that pollution contributions are so broad, 
we decide to look globally at water and air pollution and how they affect our world while analyzing the 
salary of a particular country. Before analyzing our dataset, we wanted to answer three research questions
given our datasets. 
1) How does the level of pollution vary in regions with different levels of income? Can income 
predict pollution for a given area?
2) Do air pollution and water pollution always overlap? Is air pollution a good predictor of water 
pollution and vice versa?
3) Do bordering countries always have similar or identical air qualities?  If not, is a 
difference in individual national environmental policies to blame for air quality difference?
Given our research questions, we are motivated in finding answers as to what may be the reason why 
certain countries higher water and air pollution have compared to others. We think that salary and 
overall GDP could play a factor into how globally pollution is correlated. We want to tell a 
story of the alarming global emissions and how society can help the earth with protecting mother 
nature with potentially how changes can happen today. We want to use data science to raise awareness 
of the global rates of pollutions with hopes of motivating action for all generations as pollution 
affects everyone, regardless of social class. Although we are discovering new details of water and 
air pollution, we hope to discover new findings we never thought of. We believe countries with 
less salary would generally lead to lower pollution but is this true for every case globally? 
Is there anything happening politically that could drive pollution to higher levels compared to 
countries without political problems? We find this is important for everyone as the target audience 
applies to everyone. The target audience of this project are individuals or organizations concerned 
about the environmental pollution in different regions. Specifically, people who are interested in 
learning about the pollution disparity between different countries and regions can look to the findings
of this project for information. For example, regional organizations focused on improving and advocating
for more sustainability measures could use this information to support their cause, such as placing 
attainable goals based on comparing with data from similar regions.

Conclusions: 
Based on our results, we can see a correlation of water and air pollution vs. the annual salary of a 
country. For example, the air quality pollution graph shows from 0-100 with poor quality highlighted
as red and becomes lighter to yellow with best air quality. We can see based on our data that first 
world countries have better air quality. In The United States for example we see a light-yellow color 
showing a better air quality compared to countries such as China having a red color. China having a 
red color show that their air quality over time is worse compared to the United States. We see this 
trend also when analyzing other countries such as India, Mali, and Russia being second and third-world
countries. Moving to water quality pollution, we used a similar methodology with our air pollution by 
looking at our data set and manipulating the columns. We saw that there was so much data for each 
country for water and air pollution, that we decided to create a water score where we take 100 â€“ the 
water score to get its predicted score of water pollution. This way, we can see by the predicted air
and water pollution to plot globally. The data shows us that air pollution is like water pollution 
with generally, first world countries have less air and water pollution when compared to second and 
third world countries. This correlates also when looking at salary data of each country with first 
world countries having higher salaries compared to Russia for example. Using our methodology with 
data filtering and manipulation, we see our initial thoughts of salary playing a part of pollution 
globally. When looking at our other graphs, we decided to not use map plotting and instead use the 
large dataset given to us to see if there was a trend line between our pollution vs. salary data.
The methodology for creating these plots that are not map plots was grouping by columns and analyzing
by using ggplot with some plots being scatter and line plots. We see the graphs showing similar trends
with the pollution rates from our map data with first world countries (having higher median salary) 
contributing to our results of pollution. When we look at statistics such as Afghanistan having lower
median salary and higher pollution compared to the United States shows that our data is proving initial 
thoughts of higher median salary having lower emissions.
